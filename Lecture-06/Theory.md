## Layouts

- Pages are `route-specific` UI components.

- A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages in your app.

### How To Create Layouts

- Default export a React component from a `layout.js` or `layout.tsx` file.

- That component takes a `children` prop, which Next.js will populate with your page content.
