## Navigation

### File based routing system

- Defining routes for our application's root, nested routes, dynamic routes, and catch-all routes.

- We've been typing URLs directly in the browser to test these routes.

- Users:
  1) Click on links 
  2) Get redirected after certain actions

### Link Component Navigation

- For client-side navigation, Next.js gives us the <Link> component.

- The Link component is a React component that extends the HTML "<a>" element, and it's the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.

- To use it, we'll need to import it from `next/link`.
