## ROUTING

- Next.js has a file-system based routing system.

- URLs: You can access in your browser are determined by how you organize your files and folders in your code.

## Routing conventions

1. All routes must live inside the app folder.

2. Route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx.

3. Each folder represents a segment of the URL path when these conventions are followed, the file automatically becomes available as a route.
